# TAOBench
A distributed database benchmark based on TAO's workload

Our benchmark currently supports four distributed databases (which are available on different branches). To run a benchmark, download and unzip the workload configuration files on the `main` branch. Copy these into the `src` directory of the DB branch to be run and follow the README on that branch.
